Having a go at using my kindle as a clock/weather dashboard

Key think is that I will be publishing images of the time + weather, kindle will be a convenient display but of course you could use any web-enabled device that'll show an image.

Thinking of using a Pi as the web server but that's just arbritrary, it'll probably be a pure python web server and implementation.
